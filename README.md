# Analog and RF Testchip on Skywaters 130nm Technology.

In this tapeout, we are planning to achieve the following:
- 5 Transistor OTA with trimming resistors to adjust bias. [Completed with Layout, without the trimming resistor]
- LDO [Schematic is complete, no layout currently]
- VCO at 2.45GHz for BT, Wifi applications [Tentative plan and in progress]


## OTA Design
- Simulated Gain 40dB across all corners.

## LDO Design
- Input voltage is 1.8V
- Will add the specs later.

## Schedule and timeline:

### Monday December 7th, 2020
- Complete the layout of trimming resistor for biasing of the 5 Transistor OTA

### Thursday December 10th, 2020
- Complete the LDO layout.

## Thursday December 17th, 2020
- Add a second stage for the OTA and have double stage OTA to achieve higher gain.
